# gridsim

A collection of tools and scenarios to explore the impact of EVs, storage and V2X. Based on [pypsa](https://pypsa.org)

# Ideas to explore

- Simulate typical home usage patterns and scenarios
- Scale up a residential network with multiple nodes
- Simulate the ability to avoid fossil-based dispatchable power during peak demand (gas peakers)
- Introduce real historical weather and renewables generation from NEM observations and data sets
- Compare simple smart charging to actual V2G
